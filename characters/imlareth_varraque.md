# Imlareth Varraque
**Master of Mitholian**
Imlareth of the House of Varraque, Master of Mitholian, is a necromancer of unparalleled renown. His influence extends across numerous realms, casting a shadow that evokes dread in some and a glimmer of hope in others.

## Early History
Born beneath the shimmering veils of the astral cosmos in the renowned Port City of Thalorien, Imlareth Varraque was the first scion of the affluent Varraque family, led by his father Orlethym and mother Caevara. Though the celestial currents of his home on the Astral Plane were serene and timeless, Imlareth’s spirit was touched by a restlessness uncommon among his kind. From an early age, he exhibited a brilliant intellect and an impatience that set him apart from his kin, characteristics that were only sharpened by his interactions with the myriad shorter-lived races that frequented the markets of Thalorien.

The Varraque family, possessing considerable influence as wealthy merchants with ownership of a small fleet of spelljammers, thrived in the plutocracy that governed Thalorien. These vessels, capable of navigating the myriad planes of existence, often brought tales and treasures from far-off lands, feeding young Imlareth's voracious curiosity and his disdain for what he perceived as the complacency and pretentiousness of his fellow kin.

Tragedy, however, would strike the Varraque family when Imlareth's beloved sister, Vanua, fell victim to a raid by Githyanki pirates, a ruthless race known for their savagery across the Astral Plane. Her untimely death ignited a fervent loathing in Imlareth for all Gith, a bitterness that grew like a dark star in his heart. Seeking to channel his grief and his intellectual prowess, Imlareth implored his family to petition the venerable Master Soris Callorhond, a wizard of great renown, to take him as an apprentice. Under the tutelage of Master Soris, Imlareth’s understanding of the arcane arts flourished, his innate talent for magic blossoming amidst scrolls and spells. Yet, even as he neared the completion of his apprenticeship, the confines of scholarly life and the persistent ache of his sister’s absence weighed heavily upon him.

It was with a heavy yet defiant heart that Imlareth decided to cast aside the expectations of Thalorien society and his destined merchant life. Driven by a yearning for action and perhaps a subconscious desire for retribution, he left behind the celestial tranquility of Thalorien. With only his magical prowess and a restless spirit as his guides, Imlareth set forth to forge his path as an adventurer. In the myriad realms of the endless Multiverse, he now seeks to etch his story, one adventure at a time, driven now by his hunger for understanding of the cosmos and the relentless quest to prove his worth.
