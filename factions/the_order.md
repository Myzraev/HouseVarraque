# The Order of Morcirth

**Leader(s)**: Imlareth Varraque  
**Type**: Circle of Magi  
**Objectives**: Fighting and containing Abyssal threats, maintaining balance across the multiverse  
**Base of Operations**: Tor Zul'Karnath, Mitholian  

The Order of Morcirth, founded by the necromancer Imlareth Varraque, is dedicated to combating and containing demonic threats, and maintaining balance across the multiverse by fighting against the forces of the Abyss. Operating from the towering stronghold of Tor Zul'karnath within Mitholian, the Order stands as a bastion of arcane might and vigilance against the abyssal scourge. Tor Zul'karnath, an imposing structure of dark stone and eldritch energy, houses the Order's extensive collection of magical artifacts and arcane lore focused on the Abyss. Its dungeons are fortified with numerous magical prisons, containing some of the most dangerous demonic entities in existence.

Usually comprised of powerful spellcasters from diverse realms -although there are exceptions-, the Order is small in number but immense in capability. Its members, drawn by a common cause, wield unparalleled magical prowess and are empowered to call upon the vast resources of Mitholian to support their mission. Their combined strength and expertise make them a formidable force against the abyssal onslaught.

Members of the Order are encouraged to gather personal power and maintain their independence, allowing for a diverse array of skills and knowledge within their ranks. However, when demonic threats arise or critical arcane knowledge is needed, they unite their efforts to confront and neutralize the danger, safeguarding the multiverse from the insidious forces of the Abyss.

The Order of Morcirth is a testament to Imlareth's vision and mastery, upholding the delicate balance of the multiverse through relentless vigilance and unyielding resolve. Their commitment ensures that the demonic scourge is kept at bay, protecting countless realms from the chaos of the Abyss.
