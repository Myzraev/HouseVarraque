# Mitholian  
**The Citadel**  
*Orbiting the Starry Shores on the astral plane*  

Deep within the expanse of the Astral Plane lies Mitholian, a formidable citadel carved into the vast skull of a dead god. Ruled with unwavering authority by Imlareth Varraque, a necromancer of immense power, Mitholian stands as a bastion of arcane mastery and necromantic might.

The skull's exterior resembles a darkened wizard's tower, its jagged spires and arches casting ominous shadows against the ethereal mist that swirls around it. Within its hollowed depths, Mitholian's labyrinthine streets wind through shadowed alleys and towering necropolis spires. Here, both living underlings and undead constructs serve Imlareth Varraque under the veil of dark magic, perpetuating his dominion over life and death.

Within the center of Mitholian's Crown, amidst its sepulchers and towers, lies a plaza where arcane portals shimmer with otherworldly energy. These portals serve as the primary means of travel to and from the citadel, connecting it to distant realms across the Multiverse. Port Gravemaw, nestled within the skull's cavernous maw, remains a rare and coveted hub of activity amidst the silent astral void, where occasional spelljammers dock to trade in rare arcana, artifacts, and exotic materials.

The air within Mitholian carries the scent of incense and necrotic energies, while arcane runes and wards shimmer ominously upon the citadel's walls, safeguarding its necromantic secrets from prying eyes. Whispers of forgotten lore and the clinking of bone echo through the ethereal corridors, beckoning adventurers to tread carefully or face the wrath of its master, the Lord Varraque. The citadel stands as a testament to his mastery over death and magic, a dark sanctuary within the ever-shifting planes of existence.

## History  
The citadel of Mitholian, perched within the immense skull of an eons-old, nameless god afloat in the Astral Plane, bears witness to a history shrouded in the mists of time. The skull itself is a relic of ancient epochs, where only the gods would recall the forgotten name of the deity it once was.

The foundation of Mitholian's power lies in a pact forged by Imlareth with a devil from Baator, a pact that granted him access to a damaged yet intact Mythallar from the lost empire of Netheril. Through arcane prowess and infernal influence, Imlareth painstakingly repaired and altered the Mythallar's ancient enchantments, reshaping its magical properties to fuel the citadel with immense arcane energies.

The construction of Mitholian itself was a monumental undertaking orchestrated largely by Imlareth's own hand. With the aid of wizardly allies, infernal bargains, and his inexhaustible undead horde, the necromancer directed the shaping of its black stone and exotic materials sourced from across the Multiverse. Adventurers were hired to locate and safeguard rare deposits of these materials, while Imlareth's undead minions traversed realms to gather these necessary resources. Spelljammers, arriving from Thalorien, the astral port city from whence Imlareth's family hails also played a crucial role in transporting materials directly to Mitholian.

As towers rose and necropolis spires stretched towards the astral skies, Mitholian emerged as a testament to Imlareth's ambition and mastery over both life and death. Within its shadowed corridors and arcane halls, the citadel became a dark sanctuary where necromantic secrets intertwined with ancient magics, guarded by the ominous presence of its enigmatic ruler.
